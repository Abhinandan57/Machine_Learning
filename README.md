# Machine_Learning
ðŸ”‘ This repository contains the models of important Machine Learning algorithms for Data Science to handle both regression and classification problem statements. 

ðŸ“Œ The models are created by following the data science pipeline i.e., Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning etc. The codes will be the part of my learning.  

The algorithms covered are:  

- Linear Regression
- Logistics Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means
- Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LightGBM)
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
- Categorical Boosting (CatBoost)
